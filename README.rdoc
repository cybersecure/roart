== DESCRIPTION:
If you are using Best Practical's Request Tracker (RT) and you need to interact with tickets from other applications, Roart provides an interface that is slightly reminiscent of ActiveRecord.


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Access RT Tickets through an ActiveRecord like API

* This has only been tested against RT 3.6. Changes to the REST interface in later versions of RT may break stuff.

== SYNOPSIS:

* Create a class to interact with your ticket system

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'roart'

    class Ticket < Roart::Ticket
      connection :server => 'http://my.rt.server.com', :user => 'myuser', :pass => 'mypass'

    end

* Search for tickets

    my_tickets = Ticket.find(:all, :queue => 'Scutters', :status => [:new, :open])
    my_tickets.each do |ticket|
      puts ticket.subject
    end

    #-> New John Wayne packages
    #-> Medi-lab training

* See all info for a ticket

    my_ticket = Ticket.find(:first, :queue => 'Issues', :status => :new)
    ticket.creator #-> rimmer@reddwarf.com
    ticket.subject #-> Where is the Bomb?

* Get history for a ticket

    my_ticket.histories #-> Returns an array of history objects

* Create a new ticket

    issue = Ticket.new(:queue => 'some_queue', :subject => 'This is not working for me')
    issue.id #-> 'ticket/new'
    issue.save
    issue.id #-> 23423

* Update a ticket

    ticket = Ticket.find(23452)
    ticket.subject #-> "Some Subject for a ticket."
    ticket.subject #-> "Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast."
    ticket.save
    ticket.subject #->"Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast."

* Comment on a Ticket
    ticket = Ticket.find(23452)
    ticket.comment("This is a lovely Ticket", :time_worked => 45, :cc => 'someone@example.com'))

* Attachments

RT REST does support attachments on ticket create and update.
Comments have to be used instead.

    # File path
    ticket.comment("This is a comment", :attachments => "/tmp/filename.txt")

    # Attachment as a file descriptor
    ticket.comment("This is a comment", :attachments => File.open("/tmp/filename.txt", "rb"))

    # Attachment as a ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile instance
    ticket.comment("This is a comment", :attachments => [params[:attachment_1], params[:attachment_2]])
